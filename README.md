This activity seeks to foster knowledge about the human immune system and raise awareness for infectious diseases by playing and storytelling, developing and designing a 3D digital game. This program was created in the context of the research project PLAYMUTATION2 (UIDB/05460/2020) and is directed towards adolescents (12-18 years old) and young adults (19-35 years old) to promote the development of STEAM competencies: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. 

Immunity Bandit is a 3D game where the player has the the perspective of an HIV virus, navigating though the "endless" human bloodstream, while learning about the immune system and how the HIV replicates and infects T Helper Cells. The player must avoid obstacles and strategically maneuver to catch these cells and score points, ultimately reaching the game's final objective. The development of this game is carried out using Godot, a beginner-friendly game engine that does not require installation. Godot uses a simple, high-level, programming language, GDScript, and has updated documentation and active forums to discuss information.

## Immunity Bandit

This game involves players in an activity designed to foster knowledge about the human immune system and raise awareness for infectious diseases.

The game starts with a small introduction of the HIV virus and how it travels around the human body through storytelling.

Next comes the gameplay, and endless runner type of game, just like [Subway Surfers](https://subwaysurf.fandom.com/wiki/Subway_Surfers_Wiki). Where the player plays as the virus and has to catch T Helper Cells to acquire points and replicate himself while avoiding Pills, an imaginary obstacle that represents in a simple way the human fighting the virus.

The game is divided in three stages:
Stage 1 - 90 Points - What type of cells HIV infects and what do they do.
Stage 2 - 170 Points - How HIV replicates and its consequences.
Stage 3 and Final - 260 Points - How to stay protected against viruses and HIV

Keys:
Arrows - Left and Right
Up arrow - Jump

**Workshop 4 of the Game-It-Yourself Toolbox** seeks to continue to impart fundamental concepts of game development and object-oriented programming through guided exercises to reconstruct missing pieces and mechanics of the game. These exercises include:  

- Familiarization with Godot's interface, scenes and node-based system;
- Learn the different components that compose a 3D game world such as:
  - Ligthning: Use Directional light and Spotlights to illuminate the game world;
  - Camera: Control the player's point of view;
  - World Envirionment: Defines the overall lighting and atmosphere of the game world;
- Import 3D models to Godot Game Engine:
  - Understand and use Mesh Instance 3D to represent the 3D model graphically in the world space;
  - Understand the use Static Bodies for 3D Models  
  - Understand and manipulate the different types of collision shapes and adapt to the 3D Model;
- Learn to instantiate scenes (game objects) with unique properties;
- Understand and use input mapping to create the player controls for movements;
- Learn to apply gravity to the player on jump command;
